## Contributing to ArcCreate

This document covers guidelines for contributing code to ArcCreate, as well as a brief explanation of the architecture to help you start exploring the codebase.
For translation contributions, refer to [TRANSLATING.md](TRANSLATING.md)

### General guidelines

This section covers basic guidelines for writing code.

#### Use an IDE or a decent text editor

My text editor of choice is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because my potato PC can't handle anything better. But feel free to use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) if you can afford to.

#### Use the correct Unity version

Do not upgrade or downgrade the project's version, and use the exact version of Unity as everyone else.

#### Follow code style guidelines

This project has already been configured to work with StyleCop linter, and will highlight any style guidelines violations within your code (at least, I've only tested this on VSCode, but it should work similarly with Visual Studio). There's also codefixes available (`Ctrl+.` on VSCode) which is very handy for quickly reformatting to the style guidelines.

#### Write XML documentation for public members

Refer to [Microsoft's guide on XML documentation tags here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags).

All public members (i.e methods and properties) of a class should be properly documented with XML tags (these information will even appear when you hover over them!). If you're on VSCode, the [C# XML Documentations Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.docomment) extension is very handy for quickly writing these.

The reason I'm enforcing this is that I have massive skill issue in understanding other's code. Proper documentations makes it more clear what your code is actually doing and make it so that others have an easier time interfacing with your code.

Note that you can skip writing documentation for private members, and members that are very obvious what they are (for example, the `Timing` property of a note).

#### Write tests when necessary

If you don't even know what unit test is, they're an automated method to test codes. Essentially you write code to test your code. All test code of this project is included in [/Assets/Tests/](/Assets/Tests/).

You can also have a look at [Unity's documentation on Unity Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.3/manual/index.html) for more details. This project also uses NSubstitute for mocking dependency. You can read more about it [here](https://nsubstitute.github.io).

If you're writing a complex pieces of code, and you want to make sure that it functions properly, then writing unit tests might be a good idea. However it's completely fine if you don't write any automated test and resort to manual testing, just make sure your code functions properly.

#### Discuss first before making major changes

If you want to make any major changes to the application, such as addition of entirely new features, or major refactoring, make sure to discuss with me before doing anything. This helps both you and me from wasting each other times, and I can offer some advices if necessary. For small changes feel free to open a PR without discussing beforehands.

### Git workflow

(Inspired by [NodeJs's documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md))

Working on a git repository of course requires some git knowledge. Some basic understanding of commits, branches, and remotes will go a long way when you contribute to an open source project.

Specific to ArcCreate however, to begin contributing, create a fork of this repository, and clone it. Your fork should be added as a remote named `origin`. To keep your fork updated, add this official repository as an upstream remote:

```
// Add original repo as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/0thElement/ArcCreate.git

// Fetch changes from upstream
git fetch upstream
```

Create local branches from master and start coding changes.

For every commit, make sure to write descriptive commit names of the following format:

- Line 1: `[Module name]: [Verb] [Change]` (preferably less than 50 characters long)
- Line 2 should be kept blank 
- Line 3 onward: detailed description of your changes. Add links (such as issues URL, documentation) for references as necessary.

> For example:
> ```
> Gameplay: Fix arctap display with angleX
> 
> - Fixed issue with arctap shadow y position not being 0 within a timinggroup with angleX property.
> 
> Issue: (issue url here)
> ```

To submit your changes, create a pull request. Make sure to rebase your branch your branch with upstream to synchronize your changes with the newest version from the main repository.
```
git fetch upstream HEAD
git rebase FETCH_HEAD
```
Fix any merge conflicts that might occur, and do thorough testing there before submitting a pull request.

Pull request should have descriptive names. Also attach images / videos as neccessary to help others understand your changes.

### Other notes

You're free to modify [/Assets/StreamingAssets/credit.txt](/Assets/StreamingAssets/credit.txt) if you want your name to be included in the credit as part of your pull request.
