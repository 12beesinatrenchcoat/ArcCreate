# ArcCreate

Fast and powerful .aff editor made with Unity.

# Getting started

This project was made with Unity 2019.4.34f1. You can download the exact version from the [official Download Archive here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).

Additionally, no textures are included within the repository as of currently to avoid copyright infringement, so you'll need to use your own assets. This will change once we start designing our own assets.
